# Comparison Practice with User Input
# Ask the user to enter two numbers and:
# Print which number is greater, or
# Print "Equal" if both are the same using ==.

first=int(input("Enter first number:"))
second=int(input("Enter a second number"))

if first>second:
    print("First number is Greater")
elif second>first:
    print("Second number is Greater")    
else:
    print("Equal")
