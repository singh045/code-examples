# # # Explain the difference between iterating over a range object using for ... in range()
# # #  and iterating over a list using for ... in. Provide code examples for both.

# # for i in range(1,11):
# #     print(i)
# #     here range is given to print num from 1 to 10 it will start from 1 and exclude 11 a range has given 

# list= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# for i in list:
#     print(i)
#     in this a list has created for iterating one by one
